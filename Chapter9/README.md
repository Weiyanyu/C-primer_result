### *2017-4-9 22:52*

Finish 9.3

### *2017-4-11 23:10*

Finish 9.4 and 9.5

And exercise 9.43 is important.
	Though repalce more convinue than this way ,But this way solve some string problem.(And this way reference Pazy's github,He
use std::distance(to calc two iterator's distance) and std::advance(can push iterator n step)).So this exercise realy important
(At least I think so).
